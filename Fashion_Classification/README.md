#Fashion Classification using GMM

Classifying Fashion Images Using Gaussian Mixture Models

Goal is to use Gaussian Mixture Models in a generative classifier for classifying images into the ten Fashion classes.

Dataset: Fashion MNIST dataset is used. To speed things up and reduce the memory usage, we have reduced the dimension of the problem by resizing the images to 16×16 pixels, from the original 28×28.

Some tasks include: Gaussian log probability computation, Mean Initialization, Implementing Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm, Implementing covariance matrix updates for both the diagonal and the non-diagonal cases, evaluating the accuracy of the GMM-based generative classifier on a dataset, and Fitting a GMM for each class.
